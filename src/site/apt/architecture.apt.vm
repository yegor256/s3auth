s3auth.com High-Level Architecture

  The system consists of three Maven modules:

   * <<<s3auth-hosts>>> is responsible for 1) data persistence, 2) downloading
     of S3 data objects on demand, and 3) authorization of users through
     <<<.htpasswd>>> encryption mechanism;

   * <<<s3auth-rest>>> is a web front-end that manipulates with
     user accounts and supplementary HTML pages (at
     {{{http://www.s3auth.com}http://www.s3auth.com}}).

   * <<<s3auth-relay>>> is an HTTP web server that 1) consumes HTTP requests,
     2) authenticates users, and 3) responds to them using the
     data retrieved from <<<s3auth-hosts>>> (at
     {{{http://relay.s3auth.com}http://relay.s3auth.com}}).

  This UML class/package diagram explains how these modules depend on each other:

  <<<s3auth-hosts>>> exposes a number of interfaces and just one class
  {{{./s3auth-hosts/apidocs/com/s3auth/hosts/DynamoHosts.html}<<<DynamoHosts>>>}},
  which implements {{{./s3auth-hosts/apidocs/com/s3auth/hosts/Hosts.html}<<<Hosts>>>}}
  interface. As the name explains, we persist user data in Amazon DynamoDB.

  <<<s3auth-rest>>> is a collection of JAX-RS resources, JAXB-annotated
  entities, XSL pages, Groovy end-to-end tests
  - all managed by Jetty web server, enhanced with
  {{{http://www.rexsl.com/}ReXSL framework}}. The only class it uses is
  {{{./s3auth-hosts/apidocs/com/s3auth/hosts/DynamoHosts.html}<<<DynamoHosts>>>}},
  which it instantiates inside a servlet listener.

  <<<s3auth-relay>>> is a custom multi-threaded web server, runnable as a JAR from
  a command line. Again, it uses
  {{{./s3auth-hosts/apidocs/com/s3auth/hosts/DynamoHosts.html}<<<DynamoHosts>>>}}
  to get access to our persistence layer.
