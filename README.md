[s3auth.com](http://www.s3auth.com) is a Basic HTTP Auth gateway
in front of your private Amazon S3 bucket. Read this blog post
for a more detailed explanation: [Basic HTTP Auth for S3 Buckets](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/21/s3-http-basic-auth.html).

Point your `test.example.com` CNAME to `relay.s3auth.com`,
and register the domain in [s3auth.com](http://www.s3auth.com) web panel.
You will be able to access bucket's content in a browser with an HTTP basic auth.
Your bucket will be accessible using your Amazon IAM credentials
and with custom user/password pairs in your `.htpasswd` file
(similar to Apache HTTP Server).

For example, try [http://maven.s3auth.com/](http://maven.s3auth.com/)
(with username `s3auth` and password `s3auth`).
You will access content of Amazon S3 bucket `maven.s3auth.com`,
which is not readable anonymously otherwise.
