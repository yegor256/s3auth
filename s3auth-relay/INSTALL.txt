============================

We're using Amazon EC2.

Create a new EC2 instance., with Ubuntu Server 10, 64 bit.

    tar xzf apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz
    rm -rf apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz

Copy src/main/production/pom.xml to /home/ubuntu/pom.xml

Create /home/ubuntu/settings.xml:

    <?xml version='1.0'?>
    <settings>
     <localRepository>/home/ubuntu/m2-repo</localRepository>
     <servers>
      <server>
       <id>s3auth.s3</id>
       <username>..aws-key..</username>
       <password>..aws-secret..</password>
      </server>
     </servers>
    </settings>

Create run.sh in /home/ubuntu:

    #!/bin/sh
    while true
    do
        mail -s "recent logs" yegor@tpc2.com < /home/ubuntu/s3auth.log
        rm -rf /home/ubuntu/s3auth.log
        rm -rf /home/ubuntu/m2-repo
        export MAVEN_HOME=/home/ubuntu/apache-maven-3.0.4
        export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx256m
    	/home/ubuntu/apache-maven-3.0.4/bin/mvn --errors --quiet \
    	    --update-snapshots --settings /home/ubuntu/settings.xml \
    	    test > /home/ubuntu/s3auth.log 2>&1
    done

Make sure it's executable:

    chmod a+x run.sh

Add this to crontab:

    @reboot sudo /home/ubuntu/run.sh &

Logout and reboot the server
