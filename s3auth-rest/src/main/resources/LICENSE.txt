YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF S3AUTH.COM IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. BECAUSE OF THE
NUMBER OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH S3AUTH.COM, AND THE
INHERENT HAZARDS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION, THERE MAY BE
INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS, OMISSIONS, INACCURACIES, OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THIS
INFORMATION. IF YOU RELY ON S3AUTH.COM OR ANY MATERIAL AVAILABLE THROUGH THEM,
YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR
ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM ANY
MATERIAL AND/OR DATA DOWNLOADED FROM OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED THROUGH S3AUTH.COM.

S3AUTH.COM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE."
ZEROCRACY AND ITS AGENTS AND LICENSORS CANNOT AND DO NOT WARRANT THE
ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, USEFULNESS, TIMELINESS, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH
S3AUTH.COM, NOR DO THEY GUARANTEE THAT S3AUTH.COM WILL BE ERROR-FREE, OR
CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE, OR THAT S3AUTH.COM WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER
HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL ZEROCRACY (INCLUDING ITS PARENTS,
SUBSIDIARIES, AND AFFILIATES) OR ITS AGENTS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR
ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY USE OR MISUSE OF S3AUTH.COM,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
INDIRECT, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED BEFOREHAND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
THESE DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OR CAUSE OF ACTION INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, AND OTHER TORT ACTIONS. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO

If you are the owner of any copyrighted work and believe your rights under U.S.
copyright law have been infringed by any material on the s3auth.com, you may
take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(the "DMCA") by sending s3auth.com's authorized agent a notification of claimed
infringement that satisfies the requirements of the DMCA. Upon s3auth.com's
receipt of a satisfactory notice of claimed infringement, s3auth.com will
respond expeditiously either directly or indirectly (i) to remove the allegedly
infringing work(s) accessible through the s3auth.com or (ii) to disable access
to the work(s). It is s3auth.com's policy in accordance with the DMCA and other
applicable laws to reserve the right to terminate access to the s3auth.com (or
any part of those services) for any user who is either found to infringe third-
party copyright or other intellectual property rights, including repeat
infringers, or who s3auth.com, in its sole discretion, believes is infringing
these rights. s3auth.com may terminate access to the s3auth.com at any time with
or without notice for any affected customer or user. If the affected user
believes in good faith that the allegedly infringing works have been removed or
blocked by mistake or misidentification, then that person may send a counter
notification to s3auth.com. Upon s3auth.com's receipt of a counter notification
that satisfies the requirements of DMCA, s3auth.com will provide a copy of the
counter notification to the person who sent the original notification of claimed
infringement and will follow the DMCA's procedures with respect to a received
counter notification. In all events, you expressly agree that s3auth.com will
not be a party to any disputes or lawsuits regarding alleged copyright
infringement.

Copyright owners may send s3auth.com a notification of claimed infringement to
report alleged infringements of their works to:

568 Ninth Street South, 202
